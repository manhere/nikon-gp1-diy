## 5/20/14 - Received the parts

While the PCB is not done yet, I could do first experiments with the Hammond
case. Due to the limited space, I will change the PCB layout a bit and mount the
PCB upside down (i.e. the PCB will be attached to the lid). Advantages:

- No problem with missing height anymore (with regular mounting ~0.7mm are
  missing)
- Case screws will be on the bottom, thus practically invisible
- No need for screw holes on PCB itself, making much more space available for
  routing

Unfortunately, the PCB has to trimmed by about a millimeter on each side. This
should not cause any problems with the current layout, though. The cable will
stick out to the side. Using the original cable protection from the remote
trigger, we have a very clean looking connection:
